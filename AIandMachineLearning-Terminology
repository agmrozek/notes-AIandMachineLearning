1.1) Regenerative Artificial intelligence
------------------------------------------

Generative AI refers to a type of artificial intelligence that 
is able to generate or create new data or content. It is typically 
used to describe AI systems that are able to generate text, images, 
or other types of media. There are several different approaches to 
building generative AI systems, but one common approach is to use 
deep learning algorithms, such as a variant of a generative adversarial 
network (GAN), to learn the patterns and characteristics of a particular 
type of data and then use that knowledge to generate new, synthetic 
examples of the data. Generative AI has a wide range of applications, 
including in the arts, media, and entertainment industries, as well as 
in scientific research and other areas where the ability to generate 
new data or content can be valuable.
